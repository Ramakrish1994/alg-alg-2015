\Lecture{Jayalal Sarma M.N.}{Sep 10, 2013}{14}{Irreducibility}   

\noindent
Continuing the proof of Gauss's theorem : The case when the irreducibles are from the R[x]. Moving the argument to the Field of Fractions.
Conclusion : Two tasks are well-framed.
\begin{itemize}
\item How do we detect irreducibility?
\item How do we factorize into irreducibile factors?
\end{itemize}

Eisenstein criterion for irreducibility.

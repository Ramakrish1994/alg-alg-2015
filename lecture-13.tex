\noindent
Irreducible and Prime Elements in an Integral Domain. Primes are irreducible. When is it that all irreducibles are primes? A proof that this is exactly when the domain is a UFD.
A field is a UFD. Every principal Ideal Domain (example: F[x] and Z) is a UFD.
What about rings like F[x1,x2], and Z[x]?
Gauss's theorem : If R is a UFD, then so is R[x].
Proof of the theorem using the characterization about irreducibles in R[x]. The case when the irreducibles are from R itself (Gauss's Lemma).

\subsection{All constant primes in $R$ are primes in $R[x]$}
\subsection{All non-constant irreducibles in $\Z[x]$ are irreducibles in $\Q[x]$}
All primes in $\Q[x]$ are primes in $\Z[x]$

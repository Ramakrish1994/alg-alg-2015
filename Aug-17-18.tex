\section{Recap and Exercise}
\textit{Using the same notation as in the previous section of the notes without re-defining}

In the previous class, we were looking at ways to solve $\cal{AUT}(X)$. 

We looked at $4$ different problems in this context. 

Consider \emph{Problem 3} of finding the orbit. We are interested in computing 
the size of the orbit of  $\alpha \in G$.

\subsection{Algorithm 1 to compute orbit}
The following is an algorithm to calculate the orbit of $\alpha$


\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Algorithm for Orbit}\label{orbit}
\label{alg:orbit_alg}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Procedure{Update Orbit}{}
\State $\Delta = \lbrace \alpha \rbrace$

\Repeat{}
\State $\Delta^1 = \Delta$
\For {$g \in S$ and $\delta \in \Delta$}
\State $\Delta = \Delta^1 \cup \lbrace \delta^g \rbrace$
\EndFor
\Until {$\Delta^1 \neq \Delta$}
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

It is left as an exercise to the reader to do the following :
\begin{enumerate}
\item Prove that Algorithm \ref{alg:orbit_alg} eventually terminates
\item Prove that Algorithm \ref{alg:orbit_alg} terminates with $\Delta$ = Orbit($\alpha$)
\item Calculate the running time of Algorithm \ref{alg:orbit_alg}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Algorithm 2 to compute orbit}
The problem can be solved by a graph-theoretic approach.

Consider the following definition of a dirercted graph $X$.
$V(X)$, the vertex set of the graph $G$ is equal to
the set $\Omega$. 
$E(X) = \lbrace (\alpha, \beta) \mid \exists g \in S \text{ such that } \alpha^g = \beta \rbrace $

\textit{Key Observation}: If there is a path in $X$ from $\alpha$ to $\gamma$ 
then $\gamma$ is in the orbit of $\alpha$.
Finding the orbit of $\alpha$ is equivalent to computing the 
reflexive transitive closure of the graph $X$.

It is left as an exercise to the reader to complete the details
of the above algorithm includuing rigorous proof of correctness.

\section{Set Stabilisers Problem}

\subsection{Problem Definition}
Given group $G \leq S_n$ and a set $\Sigma \subseteq \Omega$, where $G$ acts on $\Omega$ 
and $|\Omega| = n$, we are interested in computing the generating set of the
following group :
\begin{align}
\mathcal{SETSTAB} (\Sigma) = \lbrace g \in G \mid \Sigma^g = \Sigma \rbrace \text{ where }\\
\Sigma^g = \lbrace \alpha^g \mid \alpha \in \Sigma \rbrace 
\end{align}

\textit{It was argued previously that $\mathcal{SETSTAB} (\Sigma)$ is a group}

Solving the set stabiliser problem gives an algorithm for obtaining $\mathcal{AUT}(X)$.
But before looking at that, we first consider a variant of the above prolem 
called \textbf{Point Stabiliser Problem}

\section{Point Stabiliser Problem}
\begin{align}
\mathcal{POINTSTAB} (\Sigma) = \lbrace g \in G \mid \forall \alpha \in \Sigma, \alpha^g = \alpha \rbrace
\end{align}
$\mathcal{POINTSTAB}$ is \emph{easier} to solve than $\mathcal{SETSTAB}$
The POINTSTABILISER problem is to obtain a generating set for the
group $\mathcal{POINTSTAB} (\Sigma)$ (It is left as an exercise to 
prove that $\mathcal{POINTSTAB} (\Sigma)$ is indeed a group - similar to
$\mathcal{SETSTAB} (\Sigma)$)

\subsection{Point Stabilisers in Earlier Context}
In the reduction from $\mathcal{GA}$ to $\mathcal{GI}$, we defined
a tower of sub-groups  where
\begin{align}
G^{(i)} = \lbrace g \in G \mid \forall 1 \leq j \leq i j^g = j \rbrace 
\end{align}
Observe that each tower here is a point-wise stabiliser of $\lbrace 1, 2, \cdots i \rbrace$
For each $G^{(i)}$, we have \\
$\Omega = \lbrace 1, 2, \cdots n \rbrace$  and $\Sigma = \lbrace 1, 2, \cdots i \rbrace$ 

\subsection{Problem Definition}
We want to solve POINTSTABILISER problem, and we have
seen above that it's equivalent to obtaining the
generating set of the sub group $G^{(i)}$

\textbf{Input} : A set of right coset representatives (denoted by $R$) 
of a sub group $H$ in $G$. 

\textbf{Output} : Output a generating set of $H$

\subsection{Schreier's Lemma}
Let $S$ be the generating set of $G$ and $R$ be 
the set of coset representatives of $H$.
\begin{align}
S' = \lbrace r_1 g r_2^{-1} \mid r_1, r_2 \in R, g \in S \rbrace \\
S^\prime \cap H ~\text{forms a generating set for $H$}
\end{align}

\begin{proof}
\begin{remark}
\label{rem1}
Note that $R$ contains the identity. 
\end{remark}
\begin{proposition}
$\exists k \geq 0, G \subseteq \bigcup\limits_{t=1}^k RS^t$
\end{proposition}


Consider the set $RS$
\begin{align}
RS = \lbrace rs \mid r \in R, s \in S \rbrace 
\end{align}
\begin{observation}
\label{thm:obs1}
\begin{align}
RS \subseteq S^\prime R
\end{align}
\end{observation}
\begin{proof}
Each element in $RS$ can be written as $(r s r_1^{-1}) r_1$
\end{proof}
Continuing the proof of Schreir's lemma, 


Let $\langle S^\prime \rangle$ denotes the group generated by $S^\prime$ 

$S^\prime R \subseteq \langle S^\prime \rangle R$ (by definition) 

From Observation \ref{thm:obs1}, we have

$RS \subseteq \langle S^\prime \rangle R$

Therefore, 

$ RSS \subseteq \langle S^\prime \rangle R S $

From Observation \ref{thm:obs1} again, we have 

$RSS  \subseteq \langle S^\prime \rangle R $

Repeating this process inductively, we have

$\forall t \geq 0, RS^t \subseteq \langle S^\prime \rangle R$

\begin{observation}
\label{thm:obs2}
$ G \subseteq \bigcup\limits_{i=1}^k RS^t$
\end{observation}

\begin{proof}
$G$ is generated by $S$. 

Hence $\exists k$ such that 

$G \subseteq \bigcup\limits_{i=1}^k S^t $

\textit{In the future sections, we discuss bounds on the value of $k$}

From Remark 7.1, we have 

$G \subseteq \bigcup\limits_{i=1}^k RS^t $

\end{proof}


\begin{proposition}
$H \subseteq \langle S^\prime \rangle $
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
From Observation \ref{thm:obs1} and Observation \ref{thm:obs2}

$G \subseteq \langle S^\prime \rangle R $ 

If $\langle S^\prime \rangle$ does not contain $H$,
$\langle S^\prime \rangle R $ cannot cover $G$

Hence proved by contradiction

\end{proof}
Therefore, $S^\prime \cap H$ generates $H$.

\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%% Length of the generating sequence %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Bounds on length of generating sequence}
In this section, we take a small detour to 
understand the length of the generating sequence of
element $k$ of any $g \in G$ given the generating set $S$ of $G$.

\begin{proposition}
$k \leq |G|$
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
We prove the statement by contradiction. 

Let the smallest length of the generating sequence of 
some element $g_1 \in G$ be $|G| + m$, $m>0$.
\begin{align}
g_1 = \prod\limits_{i=1}^{|G|+m} a_i
\end{align}

Consider partial products of the sequence above : 
\begin{align}
S_l = \prod\limits_{i=1}^{l} a_i
\end{align}

There are $|G|+m$ partial products.
There are only $G$ possible values for $S_i$ 
By Pigeon Hole Principle, we have the following :
\begin{align}
\label{eqn:php}
\exists l_1, l_2 ~~ l_1 < l_2 ~~ S_{l_1} = S_{l_2}
\end{align}

This means, we can remove the elements of the generating
sequence between $l_1$ and $l_2$, which will generate the
same element $g_1$ (From Equation ~\ref{eqn:php})

Hence we get a shorter generating sequence for $g_1$ 
which contradicts the original claim.
Therefore, by contradiction, we get that $k \leq |G|$
\end{proof}

A natural follow question is whether this bound is tight.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Lower bound on the size %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{proposition}
There are groups $G$ with generating sets $S$ where 
there are elements in the group which have generating
sequences as large as $|G|$ 
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}

To claim the above, we give an example of $G$, $S$
and $g \in G$ such that $g$ has a generating sequence of 
length $O(|G|)$

$G \subseteq S_n$

Let $p_1, p_2, \cdots p_m$ be the first $m$ distinct prime numbers
such that $n = p_1p_2 \cdots p_m$

Consider $a \in S_n$ 
\begin{align}
a = (1, 2, \cdots p_1) (p_1+1, p_1+2 \cdots p_2) \cdots (\cdots)
\end{align}
$a$ is the product of disjoint cycles of length $p_i$.

Let $G$ be the group generated by $\lbrace a \rbrace$.

Clearly, if $a^M = \text{id}$, we can say $M = \prod\limits_{i=1}^n p_i$

The element $a^{M-1}$ cannot have a shorter representation than 
as the product of $a$ $M-1$ times.

From prime number theorem (some rearrangement of the statement),
\begin{align}
m \geq \Omega(\frac{p_m}{\log p_m}) \\
n = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^m p_i \leq 1 + 2 + 3 \cdots + p_m \leq p_m^2 \\
p_m \geq \sqrt n
\end{align}
Hence, 
\begin{align}
m \geq \Omega(\frac{\sqrt n}{\log \sqrt n}) \\
n \geq 2^m - 1 ~\text{(Primes after $2$ are greater than $2$)} \\ 
n \geq 2^{\frac{c \sqrt n}{\log n }} - 1 \\
\end{align}

Clearly in this example, we have an element that
cannot be expressed as an explicit product of polynomial
length. 

\begin{remark}
The above does not rule out the existence of a polynomial 
length expression or computation for the element. 

For example, $a^{M-1}$ can be expressed in terms of
$a$ through repeated squaring.
\end{remark}
\end{proof}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We now return to the algorithm to compute the generators
of a sub group. 
Using Schreir's lemma, we concluded that it's sufficient 
to compute the set $S^\prime \cap H$. 

Before getting into the algorithm for the same, let's first
look at the size of the set that is generated. 

By the definition of the set $S^\prime$, we can only say
\begin{align}
|S^{\prime}| \leq |S| |R|^2 
\end{align}
If we have to implement this recursively, we see
that each level we are incurring a $|R|^2$ term. 
Hence 
\begin{align}
|S^{\prime}| \leq |S| l_1^2 \cdot l_2^2 \cdots 
\end{align}

We need to carefully control the size of the generating
set $S^\prime$ at each level.

\subsection{REDUCE algorithm}

Consider $\pi, \psi \in S^\prime$ such that
$$1^\pi = 1^\psi = k$$

\textbf{Proposal} : Replace $\lbrace \pi, \psi \rbrace$ 
with $\lbrace \pi, \pi^{-1} \psi \rbrace $. 

We can observe the following : 
\begin{enumerate}

\item We can still obtain all the elements because $a^{\psi}$ can
      be obtained by $(a^{\pi})^{\pi^{-1} \psi}$

      Observe that we also do not add any new elements 
      in the process as well. Hence by this change, the 
      sub group that is generated remains the same.

\item Doing the above process of replacement for every pair
      of elements that map $1$ to the same element, 
      we end up with elements that all map $1$ to different 
      elements (except those that fix $1$).

\item $\pi^{-1}\psi$ fixes $1$. Hence all the newly added elements
      fix $1$


\item We can repeat the same procedure for $2, 3, \cdots n$ 

\end{enumerate}

\begin{claim}
At the end of the above procedure, for every pair $(i,j)$, we
have exactly one $\pi$ such that $i^{\pi} = j$.
\end{claim}
The proof of the above claim is left as an exercise
to the reader.  
\begin{corollary}
We have a bound on the size of $S^\prime$
\begin{align}
|S^\prime| \leq n^2
\end{align}

\end{corollary}

\section{Introduction and Motivation}
Main theme of this course is to use algebra to solve computational problems.
Let us consider the following two problems :
\begin{description}
	\item [Plagarism check]
	Given two $C$ programs $P_1$ and $P_2$ check if they are the same
	under renaming of variables
	\item [Molecule detection]
	Given two chemical moleculesm check if they have the same structure.
\end{description}

Note that both these problems can be modelled using a graph. For example, in
the second case one could view the molecule being given as adjacency matrix.
Our aim in both cases are similar which is to check if there is isomorphism
between two graphs.

\begin{definition}[Graph Isomorphism]
	Two graphs $X_1(V_1,E_1)$, $X_2(V_2,E_2)$ are said to be isomorphic if
	there is a bijective map $\sigma:V_1 \to V_2$ such that $\forall
	(u,v) \in V_1 \times V_1$, \[(u,v) \in E_1 \iff (\sigma(u), \sigma(v))
	\in E_2 \]
\end{definition}
\begin{problem}
	The \emph{graph isomorphism problem} is the decision problem of
	checking if given two graphs $X_1, X_2$ are isomorphic.
\end{problem}

We are also interested in the following special case of the above problem
called graph automorphism problem. 

\begin{definition}[Graph Automorphism]
	For a graph $X(V,E)$, an automorphism of $X$ is a renaming of the
	vertices of $X$ given by a bijective map $\sigma:V \to V$ such 
	that $\forall
	(u,v) \in V \times V$, \[(u,v) \in E \iff (\sigma(u), \sigma(v))
	\in E \]
\end{definition}
We are interested in the set of all bijections such that they are
automorphisms of $X$. We denote this by $Aut(X)$.
\begin{definition}
	For a graph $X$ on $n$ vertices, 
	$Aut(X) = \{ \sigma ~|~ \sigma :[n] \to [n], \sigma \text{ is an
	automorphism of }X \}$
\end{definition}

Note that an identity map which takes a vertex to itself always belongs to
$Aut(X)$ for all graphs $X$. Hence the question is are there any bijections
other than the identity map as automorphism of $X$.

\begin{problem}[Graph Automorphism Problem]
	Given a graph $X$ does $Aut(X)$ has any element other than the
	identity element.
\end{problem}

One way to see bijections is via permutations. This is because, every
bijection define a permutation and vice versa.

Let $X$ be an $n$ vertex graph. 
Denote $S_n$ to be the set of all permutations on $n$ elements. Hence $Aut(X)$
can be defined as $\left\{ \sigma ~|~ \sigma \in S_n \text{ and $\sigma$ is an
automorphism of } G\right\}$. 

We now show that the set $Aut(X)$ has some nice properties. Given $\sigma_1,
\sigma_2 \in Aut(X)$, we can compose two permutations as follows :$\sigma_1
\circ \sigma_2 = (\sigma_1(\sigma_2(1)),\sigma_1(\sigma_2(2)), \ldots,  
\sigma_1(\sigma_2(n)))$. This gives us many
